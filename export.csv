[REPEAT] Infrastructure as Code: AWS Best Practices,DEV411-R,Chalk Talk,"['Alex Wood', 'Leah Rivers']","When you consider your DevOps practice, infrastructure as code (IaC) is invaluable. IaC provides an automated way to quickly and reliably deploy the compute, storage, network, and specialized services required by your applications, and it eliminates the costly and error-prone process of manually installing and configuring infrastructure every time your application changes. In this session, learn about tools and best practices in defining your IaC. We show you how to define and deploy cloud infrastructure using modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Java, .NET, Ruby, and Python. We walk you through the process of defining your infrastructure with code and then testing and deploying it. Finally, we demonstrate how to use existing IDE functionality, such as refactoring tools, code navigation, and unit testing, to ensure it all works as expected.",2018-11-27 18:15:00,2018-11-27 19:15:00,"Aria West, Level 3, Starvine 2, T2"

It broadcast 64 matches, more than four previous World Cups combined. To deliver this, they deployed a revolutionary joint solution from AWS, Aspera, and Telestream, which enabled live delivery of broadcast video from Russia to Los Angeles for remote production. In this session, learn the architectural patterns of large-scale data and content movement to the cloud over long distances with low latency requirements, the HA requirements around broadcast workloads, and trade-offs to consider. We cover how Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, and other services processed over 1.9 PB of original content over the 30 day tournament.",2018-11-26 14:30:00,2018-11-26 15:30:00,"Aria East, Level 2, Mariposa 5, T1"
Scaling Push Messaging for Millions of Netflix Devices,ARC334,Session,['Susheel Aroskar'],"Netflix built Zuul Push, a massively scalable push messaging service that handles millions of always-on, persistent connections to proactively push time-sensitive data, like personalized movie recommendations, from the AWS Cloud to devices. This has helped reduce Netflix’s notification latency and Amazon EC2 footprint by eliminating wasteful polling requests. It also powers Netflix’s integration with Amazon Alexa. Zuul push is a high performance async WebSocket/SSE server. In this session, we cover its design and how it delivers push notifications globally across AWS Regions.  Key takeaways include how to scale to large number of persistent connections, differences between operating this type of service versus traditional request/response style stateless services, and how push messaging can be used to add new, exciting features to your application.",2018-11-26 10:45:00,2018-11-26 11:45:00,"Venetian, Level 5, Palazzo O, T2"
